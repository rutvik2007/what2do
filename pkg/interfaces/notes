The interface definition should be such that all the functionality you may need from the type
is available via methods

For example if while using a `Video` type implementing the `Content` interface, if at any time
I need to accesss some internal field, I will need to use a getter and setter for it

This makes sense because it is likely that I will need to perform similar functionality with
other types that implement the interface
